## Story Map Example

This project was created for a presentation on Story Maps for the [2015 USFWS Southeast Region GIS Training Workshop](http://www.fws.gov/southeast/gis/gistraining_cookeville_2k15.html) in Cookeville, TN.

This is an example of how to create an interactive and immersive narrative around geographic data with the [Mapbox GL JavaScript Library](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl/).  As the user scrolls through different stages of my career the map automatically zooms to the location of that particular assignment/institution and highlights a breif narrative.
