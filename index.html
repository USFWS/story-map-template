        <p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers worked with the Service to restore natural island habitats in the Chesapeake Bay that were lost due to increases in armored shorelines.

        <h2>Chesapeake Bay Nutria Eradication Program<br>Cambridge, MD</h2>
        <p>Marshes throughout the Delmarva peninsula were being lost at an alarming rate due to the explosion nutria (an aquatic rodent) population.  These critters eat the roots of marsh vegetation causing complete thousands of acres of tidal wetlands.  Congress appropriated funds to eradicate the species from the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which formed the basis of my first assignment as a GIS analyst.</p>
